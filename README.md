# DestinE ESA UrbanSquare

UrbanSquare has the ambition to provide an operational framework to assess the exposure of urban areas to climate risks and to enable the stakeholders to act upon these risks through a set of what-if scenarios. This coupling between a monitoring and a prospective view is essential to enable them to understand the situation today and optimize their future actions.
The use case is organized along seven “demonstration units” in addition to an integrated Urban Twin system demonstrator.

## [☁️​ Air pollution​](./air_pollution/)
Users will have the past and present view of the pollution in their territory and its comparison to the World Health Organisation standards. The demonstrator will integrate examples of relevant policies (for example, transforming roads into walking street, Low Emission Zone deployment, etc) to support decision making and WhatIf scenario simulations. 

## [🌇 Urban heat](./urban_heat/)
Users shall have access to heat exposure indicator allowing the identification of heat islands on the area of interest, mapped on land use land cover, urban vegetation and facilities (namely hospitals and clinics). 

## [🌩️​ Storm surges​](./storm_surges/)
Flooding can be characterized through storm surge maps and consequential floods in a specific area of interest. Users will have access to the potential inundation effects due to varying climate scenarios up to 2100. 

## [🌊​ Flood​](./flood/)
Users will have access to a full environment for forecasting the flood risk in their territory over a period of 1 year from the initial conditions. 

## [⚙️ Infrastructure](./infrastructure/)
The user will benefit from an updated map of the road infrastructure highlighting the areas that would need action or restoration. 

## [📌​ Resources](./infrastructure/)
The user will benefit from integrated socio-economic data to quantify the potential impacts of a climate risk on the area of interest.
