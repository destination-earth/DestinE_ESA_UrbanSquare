# Summary and Context

- A use case promotion plan and package to share a rich resource of
  information from use cases from the UrbanSquare consortium.

- Communicate knowledge whilst promoting the use cases via community and
  users using a wide range of communication products and channels.
  (Detailed later in this document).

# Communication Strategy

Why?

- To develop and implement a comprehensive communications promotion
  package to promote and educate about the value of DestinE via the
  UrbanSquare consortium, its use case stories, and the future benefits
  of specific services and capabilities within specialist domains.

Strategy

- By the development of a set of consistent templates to promote use
  cases through various project phases. These templates will be designed
  to provide a clear definition of the problem and objective. Presenting
  a picture of the interaction between a user (human or service) and the
  system and the corresponding DestinE products and capabilities
  required, an implementation based on available data and services and
  an evaluation of the fitness-for-purpose and benefit beyond the state
  of the art.

- By using a use case template, we can communicate essential project
  content, goals and progress, all the time ensuring consistency and
  clarity across different use cases.

Approach

- The objective of the UrbanSquare consortium is to create communication
  and use case promotion products and methods of engaging with
  audiences. These audiences are informed or semi-informed and have some
  awareness of the DestinE initiative.

- The promotion plan is designed to effectively communicate the value
  proposition of the Use Case Promotion Package, focusing on its ability
  to provide comprehensive insights and support informed
  decision-making.

- We will define the format to create a one-page format with predefined
  categories (as mentioned above) to ensure consistency between
  components. The format should cover the most mature use cases.
  Additionally, a one-page sheet presenting the use case for UrbanSquare
  in general should be included.

  - We will establish a one-page format with predefined categories to
    maintain consistency across components. We will start with the more
    mature of the use cases. These will include:

    - Air Quality

    - Urban Heat

    - Flood

    - Storm Surges & Sea Level Rise

  - This same format will be used for the following and future use cases

- We will seek contributions from the various component developers to
  provide material related to each component. This can include detailed
  descriptions, visual aids, and any other relevant information to
  promote the use cases effectively. Details of the component developers
  are found in the table below:

- Stakeholder and community user engagement should be a key part of the
  promotion package. This would include targeted communication and
  outreach to relevant stakeholders, prominent end users and community
  groups to ensure their understanding of the value proposition and to
  gather feedback on their specific needs and requirements. This action
  is performed in close coordination with the University of Thessaloniki
  and the following groups who are keen to engage in the co-design or
  implementation of the demonstrators. They are as follows:

  - Toulouse Metropole & CNRS: the city of Toulouse, France, has been
    active in implementing solution to combat extreme heat waves. Led by
    researchers from the French National. Scientific Research Centre
    (CNRS), this team (the city and the CNRS) is interested in
    co-designing the extreme heat events demonstrator to extract all
    relevant additional information from satellite imagery.

  - Municipality of Suhindol, Bulgaria: the municipality is keen on
    understanding the potential impact of climate change induced risks
    on its population. The team will support the use case regarding the
    potential flooding events and the population dynamic pressure on the
    available resources.

  - Wider user community: an example of the reach of the project is
    illustrated by the World Bank who is already involved with
    consortium partner Sistema in the Climate Knowledge Portal along
    with the Asian Development Bank. Throughout these developments both
    entities are interested in the Urban Twin system integrated approach
    that has a larger scope that the ongoing activity and is more
    operation ready thanks to the use of the DESP resources and data
    wealth.

- We aim to build a standard framework and process for managing
  communication for existing and future products, as they are developed.
  This work can contribute to the further Starion communication
  programme (including stories for the website and newsletter).

- We will determine the target audience, their motivators, their
  influences, their preferred channels for consuming information and
  their current awareness. We will seek to retain and strengthen
  awareness of those stakeholders already engaged but also look for
  adjacent stakeholders who present similar needs and circumstances but
  are not currently involved.

- Emphasis is placed on consistency, succinctness of language and
  clarity of communications, whilst still maintaining a reasonably dense
  level of information to support rapid knowledge sharing.

- We will monitor the effectiveness, impact, and engagement of the
  communication programme to drive value and enable adjustments if and
  where appropriate.

# Communication Products

- We are continuously adding to a range of written and visual content
  that will support the testimony and messaging of the project. These
  products can be used as stand-alone pieces or elements used for social
  media and online.

- Examples of products include:

  - E flyers

  - Contributions to newsletters and supporting articles on DestinE
    website

  - Social media content

  - Supporting conferences and events with short tutorials and films

  - Community Comms

  - MOOC Chapter

A recent illustration of collaboration with the DestinE team was through
participation in the webinar roadshow, along with an article that
featured on the DestinE website. This included contributions from the
consortium members. Additionally, we will continue to produce articles
that highlight relevant news stories to share with DestinE at regular
intervals.

**Social media**

To effectively promote UrbanSquare's activities on social media, we'll
create a plan focusing on the upcoming DEUC community communications,
including the MOOC, Hackathon, and working towards promoting a presence
at Living Planet Symposium. This plan will prioritise developing
engaging content that resonates with our target audience and encourages
community participation.

  Hackathon Challenge

- Mentors from within the UrbanSquare consortium have been suggested to
  support these challenges

- Communication materials and support will be provided to the consortium
  before and during LPS

- Several recorded tutorials will be prepared

- Demonstrations will be developed as needed

The UrbanSquare project is enhancing its community engagement efforts
through the creation of a dedicated MOOC chapter. A structured framework
has been established, allowing consortium members to contribute content
effectively. This chapter will be integrated with chapters from other
Use Cases to form a comprehensive DestinE MOOC, providing an educational
resource on the initiatives of the project.
