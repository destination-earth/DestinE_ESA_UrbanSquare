# Package Manager
Yarn (v1.22.19 or higher)

# Additional Instructions
To install the required packages, ensure that Node.js and Yarn are installed on your machine. 
You can install Node.js from the official Node.js website, and Yarn can be installed globally using npm:
npm install -g yarn

Once Node.js and Yarn are installed, you can install the project's dependencies by navigating to the project's root directory and running:
yarn install

This will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file. After that, you can start the development server using:
yarn dev

Notes:
If you prefer to use npm instead of Yarn, you can run "npm install" instead of yarn install, and "npm run dev" instead of yarn dev.
Ensure that your environment matches the Node.js and package versions specified to avoid compatibility issues.
