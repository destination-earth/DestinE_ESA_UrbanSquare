# Purpose of the document

This document present the roadmap for the release of the UrbanSquare
components.

The goal is to deliver as early as possible the component on DESP,
integrated with the platform APIs and services. The initial release plan
presented in the proposal is updated to adapt to the shift in the DESP
availability. This first version of the software availability plan is
based on the information known at the time - DESP roadmap, initial
UrbanSquare Release Plan – and present an updated UrbanSquare release
plan that will set the pace for the project activities over the coming
month.

# DESP Implementation Plan

The DESP timeline during the first half of 2024 is reminded in the
following schema, extracted from the “DESP Onboarding Engagement
Presentation”.

The beta-testing phase held in April-May allowed the consortium to
experiment with the data access features (Data Cache Management, EDEN,
INSULA, Polytope).

The onboarding process has been initiated, with a first engagement
meeting held on May 21<sup>st</sup> between Murmuration and SERCO.

The platform was kept closed during summer. Murmuration could keep a few
test accounts active, but most of the service were not available
anymore. In particular data from DestinE Climate DT on the data cache
management system (CacheB service) was not available anymore. It slowed
down the development of the Air quality and Urban Heat what-if climate
scenarios. The access was open again to Murmuration on August
22<sup>nd</sup>. 

New users have been created for all the consortium members at
mid-September, nevertheless the access to Climate Change DT data stays
unavailable until the official platform opening planned for mid-October.

# Urban Square Component Roadmap

## Initial planning from proposal

The initial component release plan was organised as follow:

- “Air” components (Air pollution and quality, Urban Heat) delivered at
  RR1

- “Water” components (Flood, Storm Surges, Sea Level Rise) delivered at
  RR2, as well as the Aggregated city demonstrator.

- “Land” components (Infrastructure, Resources) delivered at RR3
