This use case will focus on forecasting floods and estimating the impact of flood events on the urban environment and the ecosystems in the affected areas with the purpose to help municipal decision makers to analyze and plan resource needs and to forge human-environment relationship. We will provide further intelligence about the potential impact of the upcoming floods or regular water conditions to the economic activities in order to allow better overview of the necessary resources to be planned and identify key climate risk hotspots starting from local level and reaching national and regional level to allow the drafting of management and conservation plans according to EU 92/43/EEC, 2009/146/EC requirements.
